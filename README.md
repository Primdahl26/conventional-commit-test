# Showcase of conventional commits & github actions

## Pre-commit
To make sure pre-commit checks your commit message `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`

## Github actions 
Github actions will test your branch if all commits follow conventional commits syntax. When it is merged to master it will create a tag and changelog from the commit messages.
